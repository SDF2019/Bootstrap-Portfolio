<p>Career Path Moving Forward - Current Systems Engineer To FullStack Developer To AI/ML Engineer! Hi, There welcome to my site!
 I'm currently a Sr. Systems Engineer here in the Atlanta area, with over 12 years of experience in IT industry, you can
never allow yourself to become stagnant with your skillset. I made my mind up at the beginning of my career to not allow
myself to do that. After 12 of working from a Technical Analyst 1 to Sr Systems Engineer and traveling to Israel several
times for work. I felt it was time to move my career forward. For me, this meant hedging towards my goal of AI/ML Engineer.
</p>

<p>It was important to me to learn and develop my skills for full stack development as I felt it I should become familiar with
  the development side before learning and honing my skillset for AI and ML as they both play important roles in modern web
  development. My primary focus as a systems engineer is Azure, AWS, Active Directory, Office 365, skype and exchange online,
  servers, Domain Controllers and also storage and with my learned and applied skillset I will focus on Back-End development and though it's
  the a different side of the server for me my background allows me transition into this role very well. </p>
